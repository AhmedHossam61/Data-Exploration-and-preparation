# Data Exploration and Preparation

Lightweight repository with notes and artifacts for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preparation steps commonly used in supervised ML projects.

## Contents

- summary.ipynb — Jupyter notebook documenting the ML lifecycle, EDA checks, and preparation recipes.
- LICENSE — Apache 2.0 license.
- .gitignore

## Highlights

- Checklist-driven ML lifecycle covering: objectives, data acquisition, exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, training, and evaluation.
- Practical EDA items: distribution checks, outlier detection, missing-value strategies, correlation and linearity checks.
- Data preparation guidance: imputation, scaling/normalization, encoding, and simple feature engineering notes in the notebook.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter / JupyterLab
- (optional) virtualenv or venv for environment isolation

Add a requirements.txt when specific dependencies are needed.

## Quick start (Windows)

1. Clone the repo
   git clone <repo-url>

2. Create and activate a virtual environment
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install deps (when requirements.txt is added)
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Open the notebook
   code .
   jupyter lab    # or jupyter notebook
   Open `summary.ipynb`

## Usage

- Use `summary.ipynb` as a checklist and runnable guide for EDA and data preparation.
- Copy code snippets from the notebook into your project pipeline and adapt to dataset specifics.

## Contributing

- Open issues for corrections or improvements.
- Send pull requests with clear descriptions and small focused changes.
