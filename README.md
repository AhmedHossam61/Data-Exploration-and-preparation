# Data Exploration and Preparation

This repository contains materials and code for data exploration and preparation in machine learning projects.

## Machine Learning Lifecycle

This project follows a structured ML lifecycle:

1. **Project Objectives Definition**
   - Define clear goals and success metrics
   - Identify business requirements
   - Determine project scope

2. **Data Acquisition**
   - Collect data from various sources
   - Establish data pipelines
   - Document data sources and methods

3. **Data Exploration**
   - Analyze data distributions
   - Identify outliers
   - Detect missing values
   - Examine relationships between variables
   - Determine data linearity for model selection

4. **Data Preparation**
   - Handle missing values
   - Remove or treat outliers
   - Feature engineering
   - Data normalization/scaling
   - Data encoding

5. **Machine Learning Model**
   - Select appropriate models
   - Design model architecture
   - Set hyperparameters

6. **Training**
   - Split data into training/validation sets
   - Train models
   - Perform cross-validation

7. **Evaluation**
   - Assess model performance
   - Validate against business objectives
   - Fine-tune as needed
